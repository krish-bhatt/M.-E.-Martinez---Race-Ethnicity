Monthly and Yearly All Cause Mortality (Haleigh):

Data downloaded from CDC WONDER query tool from CDC Vital Statistics. Files contain monthly death counts by county 
(for all NY counties) and yearly death counts,crude and age-adjusted death rates with CI bounds. The monthly file does not contain 
rates because the CDC does not have monthly population data. Monthly rates can estimated by combining information from both of the
files, and eon using the yearly population per county as a proxy for the monthly population per county. Query/Selection parameters 
are included at the bottom of each dataset. More information for the CDC WONDER Tool can be found her: https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#
